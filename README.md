# Dataset
The dataset used for this project was the Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset which contained 3 CSV files: listings.csv, calendar.csv, and reviews.csv. <br><br>
Given that the files exceed the 25MB GitHub limit, please download the three files directly from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download prior to running the code. 

# How to Run Code
To run the code as a Python notebook, please go to: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pUf-ZmORrV3EydGw9smEMB_QRTr6dAvL?usp=sharing. The results of the Python notebook are available for viewing in the EDA_&_Data_Visualizations.ipynb file in this repository, however it does not show the interactive plotly visualizations. <br> <br>
To run the code as a Python file, please use the EDA_&_Data_Visualizations.py file.
